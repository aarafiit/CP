## Competitive Programming

Competitive programming is a mind sport where participants write code to solve well-defined algorithmic and computational problems within a specified time limit. This repository is a collection of my solutions, templates, and notes to help you enhance your competitive programming skills.

## Contests

This section contains solutions and write-ups for various online programming contests. Feel free to explore the folders for detailed explanations and code implementations.

- [Codeforces](contests/codeforces)
- [AtCoder](contests/atcoder)
- [LeetCode](contests/leetcode)
- [Hackerrank](contests/hackerrank)
